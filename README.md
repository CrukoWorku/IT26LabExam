# Greetings!

Hello I am John Andrei R. Paz, A 2nd Year College Student of University Of Mindanao, Tagum City. I study Bachelor Of Science, Information Technology this is my submission for the course called  PROFESSIONAL TRACK FOR IT 3 (IT 26/L) code 5082.

First of all, I would love to thank the major sponsor which is Salt√© Vacation House. Without their permission, I wouldn't have done a mockup build of the first website I Created as of today.

2nd, I did some research a little bit regarding to java. The only function I did add is the bar function so that it wont mess up anything when it comes to responsive side of the website.

3rd, IT IS A CLUTCH SIR. 5:19 AM, 3/6/2024. AS I AM WRITING T HIS, I AM SO PROUD OF THE CREATION I DID. MOST OF THE FIRST PRODUCT DESIGN I DIDNT LIKE BECAUSE I FELT LIKE SOMETHING WAS MISSING. EVEN THO I FEEL LIKE ITS REALLY LACKING BUT ITS THE BEST I COULD DO, FOR NOW.

4th, I really feel now how programmers do or work when it comes to their contracts/jobs. I am looking forward for more knowledge, strategies and even ideas near future!.

Thank you for your time reading this README file sir, I really appreciate the fact you are teaching us the industrial approach as BSIT Students in UMTC. GOD BLESS SIR.
